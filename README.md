Hide Featured Image with jQuery
===============================

When you hide a featured image with CSS, the article text gets pushed to the top the article div. This happens because bottom margin of the featured image usually acts as the top padding of the article. To prevent this from happening, I use jQuery to set the featured image height to 0. The featured image is not visible, but its bottom margin acts as the top padding of the article.
